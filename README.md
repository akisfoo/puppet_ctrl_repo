Puppet control repository
=========================

This is a puppet control repository template mainly created for my convenience. It is used for puppet structures that combine directory environments, r10k and hiera. Check my [hiera_environment](https://github.com/sobchak/hiera-environment) repository as well. Feel free to make suggestions.

The practices that were chosen are described better from the people that I got the main ideas. Some of them can be found [here](http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/08/31/r10k-plus-directory-environments/) and also numerous blog posts from [Puppetlabs](http://puppetlabs.com/blog).
