puppet_ctrl_repo
================

This is a puppet control repository template mainly created for my convenience.

It is used for puppet structures that combine puppet environments, r10k and hiera. Check my [hiera-environment](https://github.com/sobchak/hiera-environment) repository as well. Feel free to make suggestions.
