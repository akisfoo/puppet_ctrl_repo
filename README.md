puppet_ctrl_repo
================

This is a puppet control repository template mainly created for my convenience. It is used for puppet structures that combine directory environments, r10k and hiera. Check my [hiera-environment](https://github.com/sobchak/hiera-environment) repository as well. Feel free to make suggestions.

The practices that were chosen are described better from the people that I got the main ideas, e.g. [here](http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/08/31/r10k-plus-directory-environments/) and numerous blog posts from [Puppetlabs](http://puppetlabs.com/blog).
